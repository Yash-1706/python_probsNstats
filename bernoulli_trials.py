# A machine correctly labels a product 90% of the time.
# What is the probability that a randomly selected product is incorrectly labeled?


# Given probability of success
p_success = 0.9  # Correct labeling

# Probability of failure (incorrect labeling)
p_failure = 1 - p_success

print("Probability of Incorrect Labeling:", p_failure)
